Data Abstraction = Encapsulation + Data Hiding.
Polymorphism - Same code exibits in different formats
Inheritance
*Encapsulation - Packing data and operations.
Compile time Polymorphism - Function Overloading, Operator Overloading
Runtime Polymorphism - Virtual functions , Function pointers
UML - Unified Modelling Language.

Class & Object
Object is a collection of data & operation
Class is a collection of variables & functions
Class is a skeleton/outlinr for an object
Object is an instance of the class

dvantages of multifiled , definitions outside
*Build time optimization , compile modified code only 
*Hide the impl with end user
*Library approach
